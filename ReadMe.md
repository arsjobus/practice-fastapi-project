# Practice FastAPI Project (BASICS)

## Purpose

To clone and practice writing FastAPI from scratch

## Quick Start

We must type each below commands without the help of AI.

1. Create a Python VENV

`python -m venv .venv`

2. Activate VENV

`. ./venv/bin/activate`

3. Install FastAPI

`pip install fastapi`

4. Install Uvicorn

`pip install uvicorn`

5. Freeze Requirments

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

6. Create 'main.py' Script

`touch main.py`

7. Import and make use of FastAPI to create a basic API

## BASIC DRILL #1

As an API Consumer,
I want to query the '/' root level directory of the API,
So that I can test the API works and see more details about it.

As an API Consumer,
I want to retrieve the item list and use query params to specify a limit,
So that I can view all the items existing in items list.

As an API Consumer,
I want to retrieve a specific item by specifiying the index / ID of the item,
So that I can check the value of specific items.

As an API Consumer,
I want to append items into a list,
So that I can build a list of items to perform lookups on later.
